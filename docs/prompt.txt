I'm developing a real-time sensor visualization application in Python called "SensorViz" with these key components:

PROJECT ARCHITECTURE:
- Sensor data acquisition from 3 hardware sources (Encoder for angle, Strain Gauge for torque, Load Cell for preload)
- Multi-threaded design for concurrent data acquisition and GUI updates
- Queue-based communication between components
- Real-time data synchronization and visualization

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:

│   ├── main.py                      # Application entry point
│   ├── sensors/                     # Sensor modules

│   │   └── sensor_manager.py        # Synchronization manager

│   └── gui/
│       └── sensor_gui.py            # Tkinter/Matplotlib visualization

TECHNOLOGIES:
- Python 3.x with threading for concurrency
- Tkinter for GUI framework
- Matplotlib for real-time plotting
- Hardware communication via appropriate libraries

CURRENT STATUS:
I've implemented the architecture with simulated data sources and am working on [your current task].

Please help me with [specific question or task you need help with].
